# First-N-Natural-Numbers

Question: First N Natural Numbers
Write a program that reads a number N and prints N Natural Numbers from 1.

All the positive numbers from 1 are called Natural Numbers.

Input
The input will be a single line containing an integer representing N.

Output
The output should contain N Natural Numbers from 1, each on a new line.

Explanation
For example, if the given number is N = 3,

The 3 numbers from 1 are 1, 2 and 3.
The output should be,
1
2
3

Approach:
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

Read the input number N.
Initialize a counter to keep track of the natural numbers.
Print the natural numbers from 1 to N.
Step-by-Step Explanation
Step 1: Read the input number

First, we need to read the input number N. We can use the input() function to read the input and int() to convert it into an integer.

Step 2: Initialize a counter

Next, we need to initialize a counter to keep track of the natural numbers. We will set the counter to 0.

Step 3: Print the natural numbers

Now, we will use a while loop to print the natural numbers from 1 to N. Inside the loop, we will increment the counter by 1 and print the counter value.
